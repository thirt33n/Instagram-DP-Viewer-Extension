# Instagram DP viewer Extension

This is a chrome Extension which allows you to view the instagram profile picture of any user (`unless they have blocked you!`).

Clicking on the extension in your browser, while being in the instagram page of the person who you want to view the DP of,  will open a pop-up and automatically loads the profile picture of the person in another tab.

## Using

Fork and clone this repository (forking is neccessary if you want to make changes/contribute), go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your chromium based browser, enable developer mode (*it should be on the top-right corner*) and click on the 'Load unpacked'  button and select the folder of this repository in your computer. Thats it you should be good to go!.
